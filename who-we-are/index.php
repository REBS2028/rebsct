Within days of the 2024 Presidential election, it was clear a massive, and unwelcome, shift was underway in our country. It was no longer possible to assume that even if the Republicans were at the helm, that we would survive. November 5th, 2025 changed all that.

<p>
And so REBs began with a simple Facebook post in the town of Redding, CT asking if anyone would like to join arms in a community, grass roots organization. I didn’t know exactly what that meant, but I knew I had to start somewhere. And then, as things have a way of doing, the networking started to take over and we grew to Redding, Easton and Bethel (hence REBs) and on and on from there. Four months in we had over 200 members, we were networking with many other opposition groups, and our material was being shared across the country. And we continue to learn and grow every day.

We are not lawyers; we are not politicians. We are just like you. We are concerned Americans (and yes, mostly women) trying to stop the trajectory of the MAGA train destined to destroy all we hold dear. We are glad you are here and we hope you will join the opposition movement. You are needed.
